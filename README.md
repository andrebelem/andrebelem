### Hi there üëã

I am an Oceanographer, from the time when the hero was (is) [Jacques Cousteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau). My graduation focused on Geological Oceanography (B.Sc.) and Biological Oceanography (M.Sc.), both obtained at the [Federal University of Rio Grande](https://www.furg.br/en/), RS Brazil in the period 1988-1993 and 1994-1997, respectively. I had the opportunity to delve deep into Polar Oceanography, with my ‚ö° first Antarctic cruise in 1994 (and the second in 1995) aboard the polar icebreaker [Nathaniel B. Palmer](https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/vesselScienceAndOperations/documents/nbp_history.pdf) (NBP94-5 and NPB95-5), where I learned about the diversity and beauty of the ice. I followed in the footsteps of my [mentor](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hartmut-Hellmer) at the time and immersed myself in another fantastic experience: my PhD in Polar Oceanography, at the [Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research](https://www.awi.de/en/), Bremerhaven - Germany, between 1997 and 2002. Back in "Terra Brasilis", I start teaching in the State [University of Santa Cruz](http://www.uesc.br/) (Eastern Bahia, Brazil) and just after that, in Santos SP ([UNESP](https://www.clp.unesp.br/), [the extinted UNIMONTE](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100054301249073), [UniSanta](https://unisanta.br/) and later on [Senac Santos](https://www.sp.senac.br/senac-santos)), from 2003 to 2011.
I got my first post-doc at the [Escola de Engenharia de S√£o Carlos](https://eesc.usp.br/) (USP) between 2007-2008 in the area of Hydrometry/Hydrology and soon after I fell in love with Paleoceanography in a post-doc at the [Geochemistry Department](https://www.geoquimica-uff.com.br/), Universidade Federal Fluminense, between 2011-2015, where I am today professor at üî≠ the [School of Engineering](https://engenharia.uff.br/), teaching modeling and climate change to engineers, as well as physical oceanography (and general oceanography) to graduate students (see at [PPG-DOT](https://ppgdot-uff.com.br/)).

I‚Äôm (and always) learning Python (Yea! It's an infinite learning curve! Just when you think you've learned everything you need for your research, a new package appears that changes everything), and I'm loving it. Additionally, I'm deeply specialized in time series analysis of oceanographic and climatic data, with a focus on low frequencies, as well as in Machine Learning ü§ñ and Deep Learning üß†. And I'm looking for collaboration on the development of analysis tools for paleoceanography and global climate change. üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a book about Timeseries Analysis in Oceanography. You can read a few articles in my [![Medium Account](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Account-black)](https://medium.com/@abelem).

 üì´ How to reach me: pretty simples - my email is [andrebelem@id.uff.br](mailto:andrebelem@id.uff.br) and you can track me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-l-belem/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andre-Belem). If you want to meet me "in person", you can take a look at my [current timetable](./UFF_timetable.md) at UFF.
 
 Let's talk ?
- üí¨ Ask me about my hobbies: cooking (I'm vegetarian), taking care of plants (I help with a community garden and also take care of a small botanical garden). I'm also into standup paddling üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, Polynesian canoe & kayak, scuba diving, outdoor photography, among other things.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: in 2024 I will complete 30 years of Antarctica! Yes, usually at the end of each year, and on a fairly regular basis, I leave for the frozen continent, do my research, meet new people and "feel at home".
