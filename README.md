### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Oceanographer, from the time when the hero was (is) Jacques Cousteau. My graduation focused on Geological Oceanography (B.Sc.) and Biological Oceanography (M.Sc.), both obtained at the Federal University of Rio Grande, RS Brazil in 1994 and 1997, respectively. I had the opportunity to delve deep into Polar Oceanography, with my âš¡ first Antarctic cruise in 1994 (and the second in 1995) aboard the polar icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP94-5 and NPB95-5), where I learned about the diversity and beauty of the ice. I followed in the footsteps of my mentor at the time and immersed myself in another fantastic experience: my PhD in Polar Oceanography, at the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, DE, between 1997 and 2002. Back in "Terra Brasilis", I got my first post-doc at the Escola de Engenharia de SÃ£o Carlos (USP) between 2007-2008 in the area of Hydrometry/Hydrology and soon after I fell in love with Paleoceanography in a post-doc at the Universidade Federal Fluminense, between 2011-2015, where I am today professor at ðŸ”­ the School of Engineering, teaching numerical modeling and climate change to engineers.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (and always) learning Python (Yea ! It's an infinite learning curve! Just when you think you've learned everything you need for your research, a new package appears that changes everything) and I'm loving it. And ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking for collaboration on the development of analysis tools for paleoceanography and global climate change.

 ðŸ“« How to reach me: pretty simples - my email is andrebelem@id.uff.br and you can track me on Twitter as @andrelbelem, on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-l-belem/) and ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andre-Belem
 
 Let's talk ?
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies: cooking (I'm vegetarian), taking care of plants (I help with a community garden and also take care of a small botanical garden), paddling a Hawaiian canoe, diving, taking pictures, among other things.
âš¡ Fun fact: in 2024 I will complete 30 years of Antarctica! Yes, usually at the end of each year, and on a fairly regular basis, I leave for the frozen continent, do my research, meet new people and "feel at home".
